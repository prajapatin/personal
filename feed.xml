        <title>What is Microservices architecture and what are the implementation options?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have come across with many people, who have different understanding about microservices based software architecture, it is very important to understand how it is different from monolithic architecture that too not only in terms of technical implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditionally we would have developed software application with n-tier architecture where your front-end, middle-tier, back-end resides on different server. So, what is wrong with that model? Can’t we scale our application with that model? There is nothing wrong with n-tier architecture and of course we can scale n-tier architecture by adding additional nodes for business logic/API layer, web layer but there are other aspects which we should consider when we develop enterprise grade software products. I will try to define microservices based architecture and then we can talk about other aspects like continuous deployment (CD), continuous integration (CI), scalability, performance etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what is microservices? If I create simple web service/REST APIs and host them separately - can it be called microservices? Not exactly because the each micro services should be self-contained and it should have it’s own boundary and communication port or other communication mechanism. Let’s take one hypothetical application use case where there is a need for an Order Module, Payment Module, Inventory Module, Reporting Module, and Notification Module. The example use case may not be the accurate real-world example but it will explain us what is microservices and how it differs from monolithic application architecture. Now if we follow monolithic architecture, we would have created business logic for each module and hosted it in single server as a web service or REST services and that particular application server would be responsible for delivering service response from specific port. What we are doing here is that we are developing software with loosely coupled pattern (developing each module independently) but while hosting them we are not making them independent, which is needed because we do not know which particular module needs higher scalability and higher throughput. So to scale the application, we actually go ahead and scale our API server altogether and what happens is that we will have to version our application again and CI, CD will also be impacted. Also if you know that your Notification module has to be scaled due to demand, you will not be able to scale it independently. In microservices architecture we actually develop each module or even sub-modules as an independently deployable, modular services and each service will have it’s own process (as opposed to monolithic architecture, where every modules run in single process). The micro-services will communicate with each other with predefined communication mechanism and also few of them will have port exposed to outside world, you can even have different versions of same micrservice running side-by-side. So overall if we want to define microservices, we will have to say it is a collection of lightweight, small, self-contained services with their own process, communication mechanism (it can be web service, REST service or can be even background service).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what are the benefits of microservices? As it would be loosely coupled and having single responsibility, failure on one service will not impact other services. We can deploy, ship each service independently without affecting overall application life cycle. We can scale one service (which is in high demand) by deploying it’s multiple instance on same server or across multiple nodes. Multiple technologies can be chosen for different small services, which are suitable for specific use case. Also testing independent service is lot easier when upgrading specific service for production. So, overall it suits well for our CI and CD scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What are the implementation options? There are multiple ways we can implement microservices based architecture, the most popular option now a days is containerizing each micro service and host it in VMs or physical machines. There are non-containerized options also available but dev-ops would be little complex on those scenarios. We also need some kind message bus implementation using which each service can communicate with each other. My personal preference is on containerizing each micro service using Docker or any other framework out there but there is a good amount of infrastructure management overhead for continuous delivery and we need good monitoring software to monitor health of each service and scale them on demand. We have been looking into Azure Service Fabric for our current solution, which is a Platform as a Service for microservices based architecture and it looks very promising. I would like to write multiple blogs on Azure Service Fabric with practical implementation during subsequent days, particularly how to create different micro services, how to manage state for each services, how to create communication channel for each service and how to host Docker container in Azure Service Fabric cluster. So please let me know if you liked this small introduction about microservices and provide your suggestions if you have about how I should improve it or anything which I need to take care for future blogs.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Welcome to nileshprajapati.net!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It is been long time I have written blogs and thought of restarting it after many years of pause. I am writing this first introductory blog after a long pause, I would be sharing my technical knowledge I acquired during my past working experience on this website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would appreciate if you can provide your comments on whatever subjects I would be sharing during subsequent days/months/years so that I can improve myself and share something back to community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would be using following source code format in my subsequent blogs:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-c#&quot; data-lang=&quot;c#&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;PrintHi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;){&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;WriteLine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Hi, &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;PrintHi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&amp;quot;Nilesh&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;prints&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Nilesh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;to&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

        <title>The quick, brown fox jumps over a lazy dog</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The quick, brown fox jumps over a lazy dog. DJs flock by when MTV ax quiz prog. Junk MTV quiz graced by fox whelps. Bawds jog, flick quartz, vex nymphs. Waltz, bad nymph, for quick jigs vex! Fox nymphs grab quick-jived waltz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brick quiz whangs jumpy veldt fox. Bright vixens jump; dozy fowl quack. Quick wafting zephyrs vex bold Jim. Quick zephyrs blow, vexing daft Jim. Sex-charged fop blew my junk TV quiz. How quickly daft jumping zebras vex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two driven jocks help fax my big quiz. Quick, Baz, get my woven flax jodhpurs! “Now fax quiz Jack! “ my brave ghost pled. Five quacking zephyrs jolt my wax bed. Flummoxed by job, kvetching W. zaps Iraq. Cozy sphinx waves quart jug of bad milk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A very bad quack might jinx zippy fowls. Few quips galvanized the mock jury box. Quick brown dogs jump over the lazy fox. The jay, pig, fox, zebra, and my wolves quack! Blowzy red vixens fight for a quick jump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joaquin Phoenix was gazed by MTV for luck. A wizard’s job is to vex chumps quickly in fog. Watch “Jeopardy! “, Alex Trebek’s fun TV quiz game. Woven silk pyjamas exchanged for blue quartz. Brawny gods just flocked up to quiz and vex him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adjusting quiver and bow, Zompyc[1] killed the fox. My faxed joke won a pager in the cable TV quiz show. Amazingly few discotheques provide jukeboxes. My girl wove six dozen plaid jackets before she quit. Six big devils from Japan quickly forgot how to waltz.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big July earthquakes confound zany experimental vow. Foxy parsons quiz and cajole the lovably dim wiki-girl. Have a pick: twenty six letters - no forcing a jumbled quiz! Crazy Fredericka bought many very exquisite opal jewels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sixty zippers were quickly picked from the woven jute bag. A quick movement of the enemy will jeopardize six gunboats. All questions asked by five watch experts amazed the judge. Jack quietly moved up front and seized the big ball of wax.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath of that universal love which bears and sustains us, as it floats around us in an eternity of bliss; and then, my friend, when darkness overspreads my eyes, and heaven and earth seem to dwell in my soul and absorb its power, like the form of a beloved mistress, then I often think with longing, Oh, would I could describe these conceptions, could impress upon paper all that is living so full and warm within me, that it might be the mirror of my soul, as my soul is the mirror of the infinite God!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O my friend – but it is too much for my strength – I sink under the weight of the splendour of these visions!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pityful a rethoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way. On her way she met a copy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin would be the word “and” and the Little Blind Text should turn around and return to its own, safe country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with Longe and Parole and dragged her into their agency, where they abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasn’t been rewritten, then they are still using her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean.
